# Start Workflow

This is the automation contract for future sessions.

## Trigger

When the user says `let's start`, `start`, `continue`, or asks to proceed without a narrower task, begin the next incomplete phase from `docs/progress.md`.

When the user says `let's do`, enter full safe automation mode. In this mode, continue milestone-by-milestone across phases, use git automation, update research/paper/progress continuously, and stop only for safety stops or external blockers.

## Required Startup Sequence

1. Read the persistent context:
   - `RULES.md`
   - `plan.md`
   - `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
   - `docs/progress.md`
   - `docs/quality-gates.md`
   - `docs/engineering-principles.md`
   - `docs/git-workflow.md`
   - `docs/research/decision-research.md`
   - `docs/research/research-log.md`
   - `docs/research/paper.md`
   - `docs/research/references.bib`
   - `project_backlog.md`
   - Skim `2.0.md` only when strategic vision is relevant
2. Run the sibling-coordination check from `.cursor/rules/cross-project-coordination.mdc`. If MyPassword is past Phase 3 without an explicit OmniAuth decision, surface it before coding.
3. Identify the next incomplete milestone.
4. State before work:
   - Current phase.
   - Cryptographic / product guarantee.
   - What it does not guarantee.
   - Current crates / packages and versions to use across Rust, Go, mobile.
   - Tests to write first.
   - Latest information that must be checked online (NIST, FIPS, IETF, CFRG, arkworks, CIRCL, pqcrypto-*) using `docs/research/decision-research.md`.
   - Silent failure risks.
5. Work in a loop:
   - Research current sources.
   - Use the decision research protocol before major choices.
   - Update research notes when decisions depend on sources.
   - Write or update tests before implementation where practical.
   - Implement the next milestone.
   - Update paper notes if the work affects the research thesis, and add citations to `docs/research/references.bib` for new claims.
   - Do not create or expand docs unless they support the product, preserve a decision, enable automation, or improve the publishable paper.
   - Apply the relevant quality gates from `docs/quality-gates.md`.
   - Run formatting, tests, lints, and builds required by the milestone (Rust + Go + mobile where touched).
   - If git automation was explicitly requested, follow `docs/git-workflow.md`.
   - Update `docs/progress.md`.
   - Report percent complete and next milestone.

## Stop Points

Stop and report when any of these happens:

- One milestone from `docs/progress.md` is complete, unless running in `let's do` full automation mode.
- Tests, linting, dependency installation, or system packages block progress.
- The next change would alter architecture or expand scope.
- A security trade-off is discovered.
- Current research contradicts the plan.
- Decision research reveals safer or better current practice with major architecture impact.
- The implementation starts needing abstractions for future phases rather than the current milestone.
- Git cannot be made safe because of unrelated dirty files, possible secrets, protected branch uncertainty, or merge conflicts.
- Deployment, push, external services, credentials, paid services, or production infrastructure are required without clear authorization.
- Sibling coordination conflicts with MyPassword's design.

By default, do not roll directly into the next milestone. Ask or wait for the next `let's start`.

In `let's do` mode, roll into the next milestone automatically after checks, docs, progress, git commit/merge, and cleanup are complete.

## Full Safe Automation Mode

`let's do` means:

- Read all project docs, the sibling coordination rule, and relevant strategy notes.
- Work through `docs/progress.md` from the next incomplete milestone onward.
- Research current official sources before security-sensitive or dependency decisions.
- Write tests first where practical.
- Implement production-quality code for the current milestone.
- Apply quality gates.
- Run checks and builds (Rust + Go + mobile where touched).
- Create or use a focused git branch per milestone.
- Commit after checks pass.
- Merge after checks pass when the target branch is clear and safe.
- Delete local merged milestone branches.
- Update `docs/progress.md`, research notes, and paper notes.
- Continue to the next milestone until blocked.

`let's do` does not mean:

- Skip phases.
- Force-push.
- Rewrite shared history.
- Commit secrets or unrelated user changes.
- Deploy to production without deployment target and credential clarity.
- Hide failed checks or security trade-offs.
- Diverge silently from MyPassword's shared crypto patterns.

## End Result

The long-term end result of repeated `let's do` runs is:

- A production-quality post-quantum identity reference implementation.
- `oss/crypto-core` provides audited or NIST-aligned PQC primitives, vault format, and ZK circuits with documented soundness.
- `proprietary/backend` provides verifying endpoints with replay protection, structured non-secret logs, and persisted ciphertext / public keys / OPAQUE-style records only.
- `oss/client-mobile` provides a vault-based reference UX with no long-lived unlocked state.
- Research notes, `docs/research/paper.md`, and `docs/research/references.bib` evolve alongside the implementation.
- Documentation stays lean: no filler docs, no repeated summaries, no notes that do not support the product or paper.
- Every completed milestone is tested, documented, committed, merged, and reflected in `docs/progress.md`.
- Cross-language interop is closed before any production flow that crosses the boundary ships.

A single `let's do` run ends when:

- The project reaches the next major human decision point.
- A safety stop is hit.
- External credentials/infrastructure are required.
- The requested runtime budget or environment limits make continuing impractical.
- All tracked milestones are complete.

## Anti-Overengineering Check

Before each implementation step, ask:

- Does this serve the current milestone, or a future phase?
- Can a narrower type, function, or module express the same invariant?
- Is this abstraction justified by real duplication or a security boundary?
- Could this dependency be avoided without making security worse?
- Will a reviewer understand this in one pass?
- Does this make invalid states harder to represent?

## Completion Report Format

Every substantial run should end with:

```text
Phase:
Milestone completed:
Progress:
Checks run (Rust / Go / mobile):
Builds run:
Quality gates:
Git state:
Research updated:
Paper updated:
Sibling coordination:
Risks / blockers:
Next recommended step:
```

## Default Next Work

If no specific task is given, continue Phase 0 hardening from `docs/progress.md`.
