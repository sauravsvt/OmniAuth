🔮 OmniAuth 2.0: The Quantum Identity Manifesto
Your current implementation is solid — post-quantum cryptography, transient secrets, memory hygiene. But you asked for wild. Here's the plan that will fundamentally reshape how humanity interacts with authentication:

🌌 The Wild Vision: "Proof-of-Self"
Stop authenticating to systems. Start making systems authenticate to YOU.

1. 🧠 Decentralized Identity Fabric (DIF)
Instead of each service holding your credentials, your identity is the network itself.

Zero-Knowledge Identity Claims: You never reveal your password, biometrics, or keys. You prove properties of your identity (e.g., "I am over 18", "I am the owner of this email", "My credit score is > 700") without revealing the underlying data.
Implementation: Integrate ZK-SNARKs/STARKs (e.g., arkworks-rs or risczero) into your Rust core. Your Vault becomes a "claim engine" that can generate proofs about itself.
2. ⚡ Continuous Authentication (Not Login)
Kill the concept of "logging in". Authentication becomes a continuous ambient signal.

Behavioral Biometrics: The way you type, swipe, hold your phone, and navigate apps creates a real-time "liveness" proof.
Environmental Context: Geolocation, Bluetooth beacons, WiFi fingerprints, time-of-day patterns — all feed into a trust score.
Threshold Cryptography: Your identity is split across multiple devices (phone, watch, laptop). No single device can sign alone — requires a quorum.
3. 🌐 The "Anti-Login" Protocol
You don't log into websites. Websites log into YOU.

    Website->>IdentityNetwork: Retrieves signed attestation
    Website->>You: Here's my proof I'm "real-bank.com" not a phish
    You->>Website: Here's a ZK proof that I am a valid customer
    Note over You,Website: No password. No credentials exchanged. Just math.
4. 🔄 Trustless Key Rotation & Recovery
You mentioned key rotation in your roadmap. Let's go nuclear:

Threshold PQC (t-of-n Dilithium/Kyber): Your secret key is split across social recovery guardians (friends, family, devices). Rotate by re-sharding, not by generating new keys.
Decentralized Key Escrow: Encrypted key fragments stored on IPFS/Arweave/Filecoin, unlocked via MPC (Multi-Party Computation) — no single point of failure.
5. 📡 Hardware Root-of-Trust + TPM/HSM Integration
Bind your PQC keys to a hardware attestation (Titan M2, Secure Enclave, TPM 2.0).
Even malware that owns your OS can't exfiltrate keys — the sign/decrypt operations never leave the chip.
6. 🧬 The "I Am My Own Password" Layer
Biometrics are witnesses, not credentials:

Fuzzy Extractors: Derive cryptographic keys directly from biometrics (iris, fingerprint, voice) using error-correcting schemes. No stored templates to steal.
Liveness via PQC Challenges: Server sends a Kyber-encrypted challenge, you decapsulate with your secret key — but the decapsulation only works if your biometric "opens" the key in real-time.
7. 🕸️ Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Integration
Issue Verifiable Credentials (W3C spec) from your Vault.
Login to any website by presenting a DID (Decentralized Identifier) backed by your PQC keys.
No more "Sign in with Google" — you are the identity provider.
8. 🛡️ Quantum-Safe Secure Enclaves (SGX/TrustZone/CCC)
Run the entire OmniAuth crypto core inside a confidential computing enclave. Even the OS and hypervisor can't see your keys or signing operations.

9. 🌍 Universal Authentication Layer (UAL)
Build a browser extension + OS-level daemon that intercepts all login flows and replaces them with OmniAuth challenges. Works on:

Websites
SSH
VPNs
Physical access (NFC taps, Bluetooth unlock)
IoT devices
10. 🔬 Formal Verification + Tamarin Proofs
You already mentioned this in your README — make it real. Use Tamarin/ProVerif to formally prove:

No replay attacks
Forward secrecy
Key compromise impersonation resistance

💀 The Killer Feature
"OmniProof" — a single QR code or NFC tap that proves:

You are a human (not a bot)
You are the owner of an identity (not an impersonator)
You satisfy arbitrary claims (age, citizenship, credit, degree)
All without revealing any underlying data
One tap. Zero passwords. Quantum-safe. Trustless.
